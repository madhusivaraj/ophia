						<br>In 1953, a group of male college students in the Zeta Kappa Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega National Service Fraternity at Bowling Green State University decided they needed another organization to help them with projects on campus and in the city of Bowling Green, Ohio. The original thought was to establish another service fraternity at the university; however, after a number of women expressed interest, plans were made to organize a women’s service sorority instead. Since the two organizations shared the same objective of developing friendships and performing service, a similar name was chosen: Omega Phi Alpha.

							<p><br>Omega Phi Alpha was founded on June 15, 1967, at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio. It now includes thousands of women in 31 collegiate chapters nationwide. It is an organization built by and for real, strong women who actively serve their communities. OPA sisters strive to further the sorority’s principles of friendship, leadership, and service. As alumnae, members can become lifelong, service-minded leaders.<br>

							<p><br>The Omega Chapter was founded at Rutgers University in 2000 and re-chartered on February 28, 2015, by our founding mothers (pictured right).
								Omega Phi Alpha is an associate of the <a href="http://www.rutgersphc.com" target="_blank">Panhellenic Council</a> at Rutgers University.
								We do not participate in Rutgers's Formal Recruitment and Omega Phi Alpha is not a member of the National Panhellenic Conference.
							<br> <br>
							Thanks to our founding mothers' vision for the Omega Chapter and our passion for service, OPhiA is a 3-star sorority on campus and recipient of several awards including Outstanding Chapter President, Pillars Award, DM Spirit in Service, Programming Achievement Award and many more!</p>

							&emsp; Hello! On behalf of the sisters of the Omega Chapter of Omega Phi Alpha at Rutgers University, I want to welcome you to our site! Thank you for taking the time to visit and learn about our sisterhood. It is an honor and a privilege to represent such an incredible group of women, and I hope that while you are here, you can see why. <br>
							&emsp; Omega Phi Alpha is a sorority founded on the principles of friendship, leadership, and service. These values guide our sisters in everything we do, both on and off campus. Our sisters are active leaders on campus, they are academically successful, and they have a passion for giving back. <br>
							&emsp; In high school, I never envisioned myself in a greek organization. I had a very narrow idea of what it meant to be in a sorority, and I felt that I wouldn’t fit in with that community. However, I have always been passionate about community service. A lifelong Girl Scout and active volunteer in my hometown, I was looking for ways on campus to consistently give back. Then, three of the strongest and most inspiring women I know introduced me to Omega Phi Alpha, and they encourage me to consider joining. They showed me that being a sister is about being a part of something bigger than yourself, and learning the power of hands-on community service. Through Omega Phi Alpha, not only did I become a part of the most supportive and loving community, but I also found a way to do what I love. I have a found a true home here, and I hope that you are too. <br>
							&emsp; I hope to see you at one of our recruitment events! If you have any questions at all, please reach out to me!<br>
