						The sisters of Omega Phi Alpha invite you to join Rutgers University's Panhellenic Community! We are looking to recruit women who will live by the cardinal principles of leadership, friendship and service and will dedicate themselves to service. At Omega Phi Alpha, sisters find their family away from home, make friendships that last a lifetime, challenge themselves by tackling leadership roles, and most importantly, they get to help others. Membership in Omega Phi Alpha opens doors to incredible opportunities both in your short time at Rutgers and beyond. Being a member of Omega Phi Alpha is being part of a sisterhood of extremely talented and driven young women. Our sisters are highly motivated in their academics and extra-curricular activities with members on the Rutgers Club Softball Team, Rutgers Performing Dance Company, Dance Marathon, Global Brigades, Honors College, Dean’s List, and more! <br><br>
